            Will Deft finally win The World Championship?
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
            We are a few hours before the broadcast of the WORLDS 2022 finals and the nagging question arises, who will win? Will Faker, who is undoubtedly the best player in the world, or perhaps Deft after all? Delving into the story, we learn that Faker was a friend of Deft's from his high school days. Deft was always close to the WORLDS finals but never succeeded... until now! Faker has already won the world championship three times, will he succeed this time too? We also know that Deft always competed with Faker at school, he wanted to match him, but it was Faker who came out as the better one. Today on November fifth we will find out which of the distant friends is better.

            The DragonX (DRX) organization has written one of the most beautiful stories in League of Legends. A team that lost in the play-offs, but in the play-ins that is, on the last chance to get to the WORLDS group stage.... WINS at RNG and MAD Lions, comes out 5W-0P and gets into the GROUP PHASE. In the group they get to Rogue (the best European team in 2022), TOP Esport(top 4 team from LPL) and GAM Esports (team from Vietnam).  DRX gets 5W-2P out of the group, when everyone thought they wouldn't make it, and they get to KNOCKOUTS. Where they will fight to go head-to-head with last year's champions. After an even five maps, we got DRX's 3-2 victory, and the WORLD HAS BEEN IN A LITTLE SURPRISE.  In the semifinals they ran into a team they hadn't won against in many years. GEN.G favorites, top1 LCK, total crushers. And here's a surprise DRX 3-1. DRX WON THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE WORLD. It's time for the FINAL when they face three-time world champions T1, DRX with a 7% chance of winning(by audience vote). T1 dominated DRX on the first map then some people already went to sleep because it was a sure victory for T1, but in the second map DRX redeems itself equalizes the score. They went head to head until the fifth map. BUT DRX WON 3-2. they shocked the whole world, DRX no one believed in them barely made it to these Worlds, they won by beating really great organizations, writing a beautiful story
